# How to draw a weird mix of shapes guide
1.Imagine an average house - as if it was drawn by a kid.
2.Now imagine it has no doors nor windows.
3.Draw this simple house.
4.The second object you will need to draw is a big rectangle that's bottom is standing on the same line as the house's bottom so it becomes one line.
5.Keep in mind that the width of the rectangle is 2.5 times smaller than the width of the first object.
6.Then you need to be aware that the top line of the rectangle goes above therooftop of the building (so it's taller than the house)
7.Placement: the rectangle is placed a bit more right than the pivotal line of the building.
8.Voila! You have a weird mix of shapes now.
