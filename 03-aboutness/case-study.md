# Jetsurf skateboards
Jetsurf is a brand that claims "RACING IS OUR PASSION!" and it seems to be so. This company works in the market of electric products. Recently they have launched first JETSURF motorized skateboard series that is designed for fun and racing purposes. And I happened to be a part of this project being responsible for the design and more precisely - for the skateboard manual.

The task was to make a simple and legible manual that will correspond to Jetsurf`s style which is based on the rule "the less the better" and is using 3 main colors: black, white and orange.
