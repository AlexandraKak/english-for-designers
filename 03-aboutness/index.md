(P.S. I am not really into meditating but it felt like a right moment to try it for a second)


## What you should know about me
<h3 align="left">I`m a graphic designer who aims for the simplicity but strives to push it even further through the ordered chaos.</h3>
Let me explain what I meant by that: I like working with the geometry and letters. Lately I have discovered different ways of placing the objects so that it looks both: unordinary but pleasant. Scattered and exploded but sorted and neat. There is a huge charm in working with letters for it can truly be the main part of the composition without having to be mixed with other objects.

## My story
Dreaming has always been one of my strongest points that has brought me to the world of art and creation. Along with graphic design there goes writing for me. And for past few years it has become the biggest passion of mine. Currently I am editing the book that I have been working on for 3 years now and which I am about to issue in two languages. My major is really a big help to this whole process - starting off with the book cover design and finishing it with the layout that is required in typography.
