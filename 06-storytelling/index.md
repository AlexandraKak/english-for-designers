# How did I get to a point where I can scriblle and get paid for that?


## INTRO

Howdy! You probably don't know me yet but hey, that's why I am here - it`s the time that we change it. Let me tell you my story.

Getting on the path I am on right now wasn't exactly the easiest thing to do. I was torn apart by the mountains of ideas what I could possibly be and who I want to be. But every time when I felt like I am finally doing something that is truly my thing – soon enough I would realize I can't stand it and it's time to move on – time to try something else. And here I am – working on the eye-catching pictures that would help people sell their products.
Not going to lie, I still sometimes feel doubtful about this field I chose but these “sometimes”s usually get erased by “but actually…”s  and all the doubts just vanish.

## When and how did it start?
There is no precise answer I can find if diving into my childhood memories. My whole life I gravitated to art. It`s not like I was an inveterate visitor of museums or galleries but I did enjoy good drawings, pleasing melodies, nicely composed videos or outfits. All of that have always been giving me the greatest inspiration and a will to develop myself.


If to think about it, I could say it all started with dancing. I went dancing when I was just 3 years old and kept on working on my movements for over a decade since then. I tried Russian traditional dances, hip-hop, breakdance, a year of ballroom dancing even! Was the most boring one by the way. But after all I ended up switching to a singer. But then again – I couldn't decide if I want it to be academic singing or Jazz or rap. So I went for all the options at once. Then I played piano and after – guitar. Then I went for drawing...Then poem composing...Then writing...I could keep listing all my momentary passions but I'd rather show you something more meaningful.

Somehow, not being able to process my past or to take into account my “artistic” hobbies I happened to have chosen the university of economics. There I got to know real hell. And it had nothing to do with the lack of analytical skills. In fact, I have always loved math and I could say it was mutual. So the problem was rather with the feeling of hatred towards what I was doing. There I was lucky enough to meet one person who showed me the world of multimedia. We were taking the same class of german language. At some point we went out for a coffee and he gave me some spicy details about the faculty he was on - all the pros and cons, possible ups and downs i might experience there and after that I took some time to make up my mind.

Pushing the “fast forward” button we are skipping on the part with how I ended up choosing graphic design since it was quite spontaneous - sort of "why not? It can't get worse than it is now" (yet it was a direct hit).
Day by day I was learning how to "be creative", how to be patient with myself since all my groupmates were ahead of me while I kept falling behind. The reason was crystal clear - I was surrounded by people who knew what they want and why they were here. It was people with years of experience in filming, proper video editing, painting, designing etc. Meanwhile I was a newbie. At first I wasn't succeeding much. All i knew - my favourite subject was photography. I would spend 5 hours every day "hunting" for a good shot with an old camera in order to make an "alright" photo.

Sometimes I would look like a homeless person on acid - taking weird positions in weird locations with weird objects and even swearing when getting a bad shot. But I didnt't mind it much.
And despite the fact I was so devoted, I didn't make it to the list of best students - my camera let me down. Unsatisfied and demotivated I stopped doing something I had loved for years and swtiched onto design.

Having a huge atelophobia I wasn`t moving as fast as I wish I would. Tabling tasks out of fear of not making it good enough and being stuck on the same level was unnerving for me. The starting point for me was a project in which we were supposed to build a campaign for a new clothing brand "Riversign". We spent weeks planning and filming video commercial which came out great (for freshmen).

Also made a short version:

Even though sometimes it was rather awkward

After certain amount of time I moved to a different university. There I started getting better results in graphic design. Getting to like what I'm doing was the biggest motivation to keep pushing it through. Pushing it through the critics, through the frame of basics, through my own laziness and fear of failure (not to sound too dramatic).

Lately I got drawn into the world of 3D design which for some reason feels more familiar than 2D one.

There is still a long way ahead of me. You know what they say, sky's the limit and mine hasn't been reached yet.
