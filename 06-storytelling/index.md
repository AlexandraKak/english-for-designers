# How did I get to a point where I can scriblle and get paid for that?


# INTRO
Howdy! You probably don't know me yet but hey, that's why I am here - it`s the time that we change it. Let me tell you my story.

Getting on the path I am on right now wasn't exactly the easiest thing to do. I was torn apart by the mountains of ideas what I could possibly be and who I want to be. But every time when I felt like I am finally doing something that is truly my thing – soon enough I would realize I can't stand it and it's time to move on – time to try something else. And here I am – working on the eye-catching pictures that would help people sell their products.
Not going to lie, I still sometimes feel doubtful about this field I chose but these “sometimes”s usually get erased by “but actually…”s  and all the doubts just vanish.

## When and how did it start?
There is no precise answer I can find if diving into my childhood memories. My whole life I gravitated to art. It`s not like I was an inveterate visitor of museums or galleries but I did enjoy good drawings, pleasing melodies, nicely composed videos or outfits. All of that have always been giving me the greatest inspiration and a will to develop myself.


If to think about it, I could say it all started with dancing. I went dancing when I was just 3 years old and kept on working on my movements for over a decade since then. I tried Russian traditional dances, hip-hop, breakdance and ended up switching to a singer. But then again – I couldn`t decide if I want it to be academic singing or Jazz or rap. So I went for all the options at once. Then I played piano and after – guitar.

Somehow, not being able to process my past or to take into account my “artistic” hobbies I happened to have chosen the university of economics. There I got to know real hell. And it had nothing to do with the lack of analytical skills. In fact, I have always loved math and I could say it was mutual. So the problem was rather with the feeling of hatred towards what I was doing. There I was lucky enough to meet one person who showed me the world of multimedia.

Pushing the “fast forward” button we are skipping on the part with how I ended up choosing graphic design since it was quite spontaneous (yet it was a direct hit).
Day by day I was learning how to "be creative", how to be patient with myself since all my groupmates were ahead of me while I kept falling behind. The reason was crystal clear - I was surrounded by people who knew what they want and why they were here. It was people with years of experience in filming, proper video editing, painting, designing etc. Meanwhile I was a newbie. At first I wasn't succeeding much. All i knew - my favourite subject was photography. I would spend 5 hours every day "hunting" for a good shot with an old camera in order to make an "alright" photo.

And despite the fact I was so devoted, I didn't make it to the list of best students - my camera let me down. Unsatisfied and demotivated I stopped doing something I had loved for years and swtiched onto design.

Having a huge atelophobia I wasn`t moving as fast as I wish I would. Tabling tasks out of fear of not making it good enough and being stuck on the same level was unnerving for me. The starting point for me was a project in which we were supposed to build a campaign for a new clothing brand "Riversign". We spent weeks planning and filming video commercial which came out great (for freshmen).

Even though sometimes it was rather awkward
