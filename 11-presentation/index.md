Three years of studying graphic design have resulted into the analysis of the visual identity of the event called AMF (Amsterdam Music Festival) and its subsequent  creation of the visual style for the reason it‘s communication and visual strategies have not changed since the year 2013. The aim of this work is to create a visual style that will help expand the customer base by attracting new visitors. The work is divided into two main parts - theoretical and practical. The theoretical part introduces branding, visual identity, logotype, theory of colors, fonts and such important points as marketing and PR (public relations). The practical part consists of an accurate and thorough analysis of the festival using SWOT analysis, feedback from the festival staff, an interview with a well-known electronic music producer and the subsequent application of the acquired knowledge to create elements of a unified style.


Every day, not only new methods of promoting goods, services and entertainments appear, but also changes the perception of visual elements and as well as perception of their combinations. Fashion, technologies, aesthetics are in a constant process of transformation, which means that many things become outdated, flavorless and bland for the average modern man. Therefore, AMF needs a "transformation", as the visual style of this event has not changed since its inception in 2013.

## The history of the festival
In 2013, ID&T and ALDA, Denmark's largest dance music producers, held a festival to celebrate the 25th anniversary of electronic music in the Netherlands. The first AMF festival attracted 25,000 visitors who enjoyed the music of 30 different DJs. Since then, the festival has become an annual tradition with a large number of loyal fans, whose number has been growing steadily, as a result of which the festival has had to rent three concert halls at once and extend the festival to 5 days.
Before introducing new visual style for the AMF, there are several points that are essential to be mentioned in order to have a better picture of the festival itself.
- "EDM" stands for "electronic dance music", which simply means "electronic dance music". This genre is the one that is being introduced to the fans of the festival and not only does it include subtle ambient tunes, but also house music, techno, drum and bass and dubstep, where the tempo reaches up to 200 BPM (beats per minute) - beats per minute. Such music is created for long dance nights, which are most often held in clubs or outside at festivals, to which the upward tempo and appropriate perception of rhythm in the soundtracks contribute.
- After a couple interviews with EDM producers, I have found out that for most people electronic music associates with a "gradient", "energy", "trance", "erotics", "space" and "ecstasy".
- The reason why EDM genre is now in top 4 most popular music genres is because of the dopamine that is being released to our brain when the beat drops. When we listen to music, this hormone is released into the brain thus improving our happiness. Thanks to this simple action, EDM makes it possible to transform a sad mood into a joyful one.  
Based on these points, I managed to create a new visual style that can fully match such a popular and known music genre as EDM.

I started off with the logotype that is supposed to be used for most of the promotional materials.

When choosing colors for the visual style of the AMF festival, I mainly referred to the psychology of colors and the theory of color perception. 
• Purple refers to mysticism and "trance" and represents not only ambition and luxury but also creativity.
• Orange means joy and enthusiasm and conveys an energetic mood.
• Red is the color of passion and maximum efficiency ("make the most of it"), it's the color of loud and bright emotions. Red, as reported in various sources, is the color of stimulus and triumph.
These colors have been used in most of the elements of the visual identity starting with logotype, moving onto the main element:

Proceeding with the gradient on the background of the promotional materials such as posters:

Almost every propagational material has the same background which consists of moon texture as the first layer (since the new motto is "Dopamine to the moon" which is a refernce to the release of the dopamine during the process of listening to EDM). The second layer is a gradient made of 3 colors that are used as primary colors for the visial identity: purple, orange and red.
 
Most of the merch materials are minimalistic since the only elements that are used for them are: logotype and the name of the festival.

AMF have a weak communication strategy when it comes to social media - posts apear once or twice a month with nothing but the picture from the previous festival. There is no communication with fans as well as no competitions or news. Apart from it, the design of their pages has also become outdated.

## Conclusion 

AMF is a popular festival whose fan base grows exponentially, hence it needed a renovation of the visual identity in order to keep up with the times. My project is an example of that full renovation that might bring more popularity to a festival thanks to the bright colors and a good and solid concept.
