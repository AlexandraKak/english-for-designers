Three years of studying graphic design have resulted into the analysis of the visual identity of the event called AMF (Amsterdam Music Festival) and its subsequent visual creation for the reason itâ€˜s communication and visual strategies have not changed since the year 2013. The aim of this work is to create a visual style that will help expand the customer base by attracting new visitors. The work is divided into two main parts - theoretical and practical. The theoretical part introduces branding, visual identity, logotype, theory of colors, fonts and such important points as marketing and PR (public relations). The practical part consists of an accurate and thorough analysis of the festival using SWOT analysis, feedback from the festival staff, an interview with a well-known electronic music producer and the subsequent application of the acquired knowledge to create elements of a unified style.


Every day, not only new methods of promoting goods, services and entertainment appear, but also changes the perception of visual elements and as well as perception of their combinations. Fashion, technologies, aesthetics are in a constant process of transformation, which means that many things become outdated, flavorless and bland for the average modern man. Therefore, the AMF needs a "transformation", as the visual style of this event has not changed since its inception in 2013.

## The history of the festival
In 2013, ID&T and ALDA, Denmark's largest dance music producers, held a festival to celebrate the 25th anniversary of electronic music in the Netherlands. The first AMF festival attracted 25,000 visitors who enjoyed the music of 30 different DJs. Since then, the festival has become an annual tradition with a large number of loyal fans, whose number has been growing steadily, as a result of which the festival has had to rent three concert halls at once and extend the festival to 5 days.
