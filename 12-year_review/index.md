# Review

1. What did you like most about this subject? - Definetely the lack of stress and easygoing nature of you (our professor). All that made this subject become my favorite one. Some choose to go with a conventional workflow and class discipline aiming to instill fear in their students and I really appreciate that it wasn't the case. And I respect you for that. 

2. What did you like least about this subject? - Honestly, can't come up with anything. We had videos, chats, presentations and even games. Music as a background? :D (dont mind this comment, this is my drug and i am on it 24/7)

3. What were the top 3 things you learned this year? - Voice and tone contribute to the presentation in a great extent. Studying can be chill. You have to look at your presentation from a perspective of a listener - the fact something is obvious to you doesn't necessarily mean it's obvious to others.

4. What was the most memorable activity/assignment from this year? Story telling.

5. What is something you accomplished this year that you are proud of? - Learned some stuff about Github. Tbh I never heard of it before which now seems to have been a huge a mistake. But I wouldn't say I am proud of learning about it, I am rather thankful for being taught about this platform. 

6. What is one thing you learned about yourself this year? - I can do much more than I imagined. My limits are far bigger than I used to think. And I can actually handle a great amount of stress.

7. What is one thing you would add or change about this class? - Make it a bit shorter. My focus is really unstable and for me it's impossible to stay focused for longer than 10 miinutes let alone 3 hours.

8. What is one thing you could have done better this year? - No idea. Started working on my thesis sooner?

9. What is one thing I could have done better as a teacher this year? - Nothing. Teaching was on point :D It was informative, structured and conducted in a laid back manner.

10. What advice would you give to students going into this subject next year? - Pay attention to what you hear. The information you get in this class will certainly come in handy and it's not hard to comprehend it if you try- it's not a programming class nor is it a chemistry one.
