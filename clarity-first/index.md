## Key points
1. Background/importance of topic: music is one of the biggest providers of the dopamine. People seek pleasure in every way possible and the only way to make music even more attractive is to build an attractive shell for it, it's own beautiful space for people to plunge into it fully and devotedly. Electronic or dance music is one of the famous genres among young generation and the festival I am working on doesn't provide proper marketing campaign nor does it have any outstanding or noticeable branding. 
2. Purpose/hypothesis (thesis or statement of problem): current marketing campaign is no longer relevant and hasn't been changing for almost a decade now. Electronic music implies flow of time, it brings out the feeling that the future is here but the AMF festival has nothing to do with this feeling and it needs to be changed.
3. Research â€” design/methodology/approach including procedures/data/observations: thorough analysis of the market, target audience and the festival itself. Communication with the festival staff in order to get as much information as possible that could be used for a proper marketing strategy planning and redesign.
4. Findings (highlight outcome of research): I was able to have a small interview with on of the worker of the festival and get some important information about the festival which I am now using for making a visual identity. 
5. Conclusions (significance/success of study to theory/practical/society): I am hoping to build an up-to-date design and marketing campaign for a festival that could be viewed as a potential design for AMF event and maybe even used by them.




## Warm-up 
1. Problem: currently AMF festival barely can offer any visual identity.
2. Action: working on the marketing strategy along with the visual identity making it futuristic and attractive.
3. Result: growing number of AMF fans.
